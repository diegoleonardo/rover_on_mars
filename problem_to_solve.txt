TECH TEST:
A rover has been developed to map out the landscape of mars.
The rover is a robot which can move on a 5 x 5 grid controlled by simple
commands. Write a program which controls the movement of the Mars rover.

COMMANDS:
- Rotate to left: L
- Rotate to right: R
- Forward: F

REQUIREMENTS: 
As a controller user I want the rover to be able to rotate to left
- Given the rover is facing North, when the rover rotates Left, then the rover is facing West
- Given the rover is facing West, when the rover rotates Left, then the rover is facing South
- Given the rover is facing South, when the rover rotates Left, then the rover is facing East
- Given the rover is facing East, when the rover rotates Left, then the rover is facing North

As a controller user I want the rover to be able to rotate right
- Given the rover is facing North, when the rover rotates Right, then the rover is facing East
- Given the rover is facing East, when the rover rotates Right, then the rover is facing South
- Given the rover is facing South, when the rover rotates Right, then the rover is facing West
- Given the rover is facing West, when the rover rotates Right, then the rover is facing North

As a controller user I want the rover to be able to move Forward
- Given the Is as position 1,1 and the rover is facing North, when the rover moves forward,
the rover is in position 0,1.

As a controller I want to be able to see the rover's position once it has moved
- When the user moves the rover to (1,1), the rover's position is displayed in the format(1,1)

As a controller I don't want the rover to be able to move outside the confines of the grid
- Given the Rover is facing West and is at position(0,0), when the user tries to move forward, 
the rovers position does not change

CURRENT ROVER POSITION SHOULD BE OUTPUT IN THE SCREEN:
0,0 | 0,1 | 0,2 | 0,3 
1,0 | 1,1 | 1,2 | 1,3 
2,0 | 2,1 | 2,2 | 2,3 
3,0 | 3,1 | 3,2 | 3,3
