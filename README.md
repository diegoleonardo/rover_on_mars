# RoverOnMars

A simple test to solve.

## Test

A rover has been developed to map out the landscape of mars.
The rover is a robot which can move on a 5 x 5 grid controlled by simple
commands. Write a program which controls the movement of the Mars rover.

## Commands

- Rotate to left: L
- Rotate to right: R
- Forward: F

## Current rover position should be output in the screen:

0,0 | 0,1 | 0,2 | 0,3 
1,0 | 1,1 | 1,2 | 1,3 
2,0 | 2,1 | 2,2 | 2,3 
3,0 | 3,1 | 3,2 | 3,3 

## Installation
